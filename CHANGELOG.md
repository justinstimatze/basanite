## Unreleased — the known-tics reference (Claude Bingo)

A curated reference of words and phrases Claude is known to lean on, drawn
from the community "Claude Bingo" card and shipped embedded in the binary.
It complements the derived deterministic signals with crowd-sourced ground
truth, and it stays a reference, not a denylist — a seeded entry still has
to be one you're actually leaning on now before it surfaces, and the output
stays awareness, never prohibition.

- `internal/knowntics`: the embedded `known-tics.txt`, split into single-word
  lemmas and multi-word phrases, extensible with your own `known-tics.txt`
  in the data dir or `~/.config/basanite` (later files add, never replace) —
  mirroring the `proper-nouns.txt` suppress list, inverted.
- **Known-tics route**: a third chronic admission route. The rarity route
  catches words rare in general English (`substrate`, `load-bearing`); the
  known route catches *common*-English leans it structurally can't see
  (`surface`, `frame`, `honor`) when they're steady and dispersed. Entries
  are labelled "a common Claude lean".
- **Phrase track** (`internal/phrase`): the single-token detector is blind to
  stock phrases (`i want to honor that`) — the words are individually
  unremarkable; the tic is the sequence. A matcher counts the curated phrases
  over the surface word stream (stopwords kept) and surfaces the most-used as
  awareness-only entries (no synonym ladder for a stock phrase). `report`
  gains `--phrases` / `--phrase-min`.

## v0.3.1 (2026-06-10)

- The judge is now **on by default** when an API key is configured. The
  deterministic-only report is the one that confidently mis-suggests
  synonyms for terms of art (`hook → snare`) — the session's central
  finding — so gating is the default experience, not an opt-in. Without a
  key, `report` falls back to deterministic rather than failing;
  `--judge=false` forces it off. The status (`judge on` / `off`) prints
  with the entry count.

## v0.3.0 (2026-06-10) — the judge; coupled launch with stull

The deterministic detector can't tell a precise term of art (`hook`) from a
dilutable tic (`substrate`) — that's word-sense disambiguation, which static
embeddings provably can't do (the gloss-coherence discriminator was measured
and inverted). So one optional, fenced LLM judgment enters the loop.

- `internal/judge`: the cell-facing contract — per-word strict-tool schema
  confining `demote_to` to the vetted ladder (select, never invent), a
  stull-compatible `Grammar`/`Safety` pair (safety rejects incoherent
  verdicts), and a verdict `Store` that is both cache and calibration log.
- `pipeline.Build` gains an optional `judge.Judger` gate: `term_of_art`
  entries are suppressed, `tic`/`mixed` kept with the chosen rung and a
  one-clause note; an inconclusive verdict fails safe to the un-gated
  entry. Off by default — the deterministic pipeline is unchanged without
  a judge.
- The fence is stull's `spec.Cell` used standalone (verified: `package
  spec` imports only stdlib). basanite is stull's first public consumer of
  its standalone fenced-oracle entry point; the two ship coupled.
- Deterministic proper-noun guard ahead of the fence: a `proper-nouns.txt`
  (data dir or `~/.config/basanite`) of known project/tool names is
  suppressed outright — a frequency+sense pass reliably mistakes a project
  literally named `calque` for the common word. Runs without the judge and
  saves it a call. Found because the live judge made exactly that miss on
  the real corpus.
- Ablation test proves the gate earns its keep with a scripted judge — no
  LLM required to test the gate logic.
- The fence is stull's `spec.Cell` used standalone, pinned to the public
  `stull v0.1.0` (basanite is its first public consumer). A deterministic
  proper-noun guard (`proper-nouns.txt`) suppresses project/tool names
  before the fence. Off by default; the deterministic pipeline is unchanged
  without a key. Validated live on the real corpus (hook/local/transcript
  suppressed, substrate→layer, public/tier mixed) with hermetic httptest
  coverage of the request shape and the fail-safe paths.

## v0.2.0 (2026-06-10)

- Chronic-tic detection: the report adds steady high-rate words the riser
  detector is structurally blind to, admitted by two deterministic
  evidence routes — genitive-frame repetition ("the spine of X", ≥25% of
  uses) or rarity mismatch (rare in SemCor English while frequent in the
  corpus; WordIC floor 10.5, abbreviations excluded). Context clustering
  was evaluated as a route and rejected: measured on real data, domain
  vocabulary clusters at the same delta as genuine tics.
- `cloze.Corpus` keeps raw sentence text alongside tokens, enabling
  `FrameFraction` (computed over the stopwords tokenization drops); `vet`
  reports the frame share per word.
- `refresh` subcommand: SessionStart-friendly background regeneration —
  exits instantly when the report is fresh, single-flights via a lock
  file, never fails loudly, logs each attempt to the state dir.
- Render quality: chronic rungs use a stricter 0.5 clean floor (their
  multi-sense candidate sets leak more), with a floored fallback so the
  clean cliff can't silence a strongly-evidenced flag; entries with no
  demote rung to offer are skipped.
- Single-pass tokenization: `internal/pipeline` tokenizes each turn once
  via the new token-preserving `text.SentenceTokens`, feeding both the
  window counts and a deduplicated, lemma-indexed `cloze.Corpus` — report
  wall time dropped from ~2m to ~54s on a 90-day corpus, with output
  verified byte-identical against the previous implementation on a frozen
  corpus snapshot.
- The report composition moved out of `main` into `internal/pipeline`
  (`Pass`/`Candidates`/`Build`) with end-to-end tests over the synthetic
  WordNet fixture, including a guard that a riser-free corpus never
  touches the vector table.
- Hardening: report saves use an exclusive temp file (no collisions, no
  leaked temp on failure); the hook refuses symlinked or oversized report
  files and creates session markers with `O_CREATE|O_EXCL` (no
  double-inject race); transcript lines over 64 MB are skipped instead of
  accumulated; `trend` time math uses one representation for windowing,
  bucketing, and labels.
- `vet` now applies the same candidate filter as `report` (candidates
  containing the tic word are excluded).

## v0.1.0 (2026-06-10)

Initial release. Deterministic, local, no-LLM vocabulary-tic detection over
Claude Code JSONL transcripts.

- Corpus reader: walks the transcript tree, extracts non-sidechain assistant
  prose (skips `thinking`, `tool_use`, and subagent transcripts),
  mtime-prunes files older than the analysis window.
- Tokenizer: strips code fences, inline code, URLs, and paths before
  counting; keeps hyphenated words; conservative lemmatizer (plurals and
  possessives only).
- `scan`: rising-lemma detector — recent window vs trailing baseline, scored
  by outside-loudest-project count × log rate ratio with a ratio floor, so
  diction tics separate from single-project topic words.
- `trend`: weekly per-lemma rates straight from the transcripts — the
  effectiveness check, and the view that catches chronic
  (baseline-saturated) tics that delta-over-baseline can't see.
- `ladder`: per-sense specificity ladders — WordNet 3.0 synonyms, hypernym
  demote rungs, and adjective similar-to clusters, ordered weakest →
  strongest by Resnik IC (SemCor table) with word-frequency IC fallback.
- `vet`: cloze substitution against the writer's own past sentences via
  GloVe 100d mean-pooled vectors, ranked by clean-substitution count, with
  signature-vs-tic classification as a clustering delta over a corpus
  baseline.
- `report` + `hook`: the turn-start loop — `report` composes the pipeline
  offline into JSON state; `hook` injects the rendered ladders (demote
  direction only) on UserPromptSubmit once per session in ~4 ms, silently
  skipping stale or missing state.
- `scripts/fetch-data.sh` fetches the data assets (WordNet 3.0, SemCor IC
  tables, GloVe 6B) from their origins; nothing is redistributed here.
